## Notes

**Dwarf Fortresss**

About the free version (without pretty graphics), the ability to run in a terminal was dropped during the Steam rewrite.
If you want to play on the terminal you will have to play version 0.47.05 or older.
They still use ASCII graphics in the newer versions, its just that they use their own SDL based renderer.
